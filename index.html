            <p>First Steps in Music is a music education curriculum developed by the researcher and pedagogue 
            Dr. John Feierabend. It utilizes an eight-step lesson structure to foster and promote musicality
            children from an early age. 
            </p>
            <p>Musicality in the First Steps curriculum is described in three ways: 
                <br>
                <br>Tuneful - to audiate and replicate melodies and harmonies
                <br>Beatful - to feel the pulse of music and recognize meter
                <br>Artful - to be moved by music and to express those feelings
            </p>

        <h2 id="eight">The Eight Steps</h2>
        <p>Below you will find each of the eight steps, as well as an explanation of 
            how they contribute to the development of tuneful, beatful, and artful musicians.
        </p>

        <h3>Pitch Exploration (Vocal Warm-ups)</h3>
        <p>In the world of sports, it is well known that warm-ups help maintain and improve stamina, 
            flexibility, and agility. In the musical world, things work just about the same. 
            
            <br>Pitch exploration is a way to get young students building a connection to their voice. 
            In this step, they can experiment with different tones, different volumes, different ranges. 
            <br>As the curriculum starts to spiral up, this also becomes an opportunity for students to begin 
            connecting the sounds they make with various forms of graphic notation. 
            <br>These exercises and activities help children build the physical muscles needed for healthy 
            vocal technique, as well as develop greater capacity for abstract thinking. 
        </p>

        <h3>Fragment Singing, Echo Songs, Call and Response Songs</h3>
        <p>This step works pattern recognition, memory, and vocal coordination. The youngest students begin 
            interacting with simple tonal patterns (usually sol-la-mi or do-re-mi). 
            <br>They learn to aurally identify those tonal patterns, anticipate the logical resolution of the 
            patterns, and reproduce the patterns themselves with their voice. 
            <br>This step also models music as a two-way communication method, encouraging students to listen
            and respond as the situation demands.
            <br>As age and skill level increase, the tonal patterns and "musical dialogue" become more complex.
        </p>

        <h3>Simple Songs</h3>
        <p>Simple songs are exactly what they sound like. They are uncomplicated and brief melodies that 
            incorporate many of the tonal patterns and implied cadences 
            <br>students have explored in the previous step. They provide an opportunity to further contextualize 
            the aural skills that have been being developed, while simultaneously 
            <br> allowing children to engage with playful lyrics. As many of these songs are more strictly 
            metered than anything we would use in step 2, it also adds an 
            <br>additional rhythmic component to the music.
        </p>

        <h3>Arioso (Improvisation)</h3>
        <p>Arioso is an Italian word meaning airy, windy, or gusty. It is an excellent term for what we 
            do during this step. 
            <br>When most people think of musical improvisation, they are usually thinking of the jazz 
            masters who seemed to pull fantastically convoluted melodies out of thin air. 
            <br>While our students aren't quite there yet, we begin building their ability to create 
            on the spot within a predetermined context. The youngest may start by improvising 
            <br>unmetered words on a single pitch, or within one of our previously explored tonal 
            patters (sol-la-mi or do-re-mi). Over time, their creations will take on
            <br>a more clearly defined structure-- with stronger tonal centers and meter. 
        </p>

        <h3>Songtales</h3>
        <p>Songtales are stories told in song. They tend to have folk roots and more often than
            not were passed on through oral tradition for centuries before they were written down.
            <br>Songtales are an opportunity to explore the way music has shaped and preserved cultures 
            throughout history. Students reflect on the way common melodies have been used to 
            <br>disseminate critical information or pass on cultural practices, while also enjoying
            silly stories and participating in communal music-making.
         </p>

        <h3>Movement Exploration (Movement Warm-ups)</h3>
        <p>Similarly to our vocal warm-ups, movement warm-ups help improve stamina, flexibility, and 
            agility. Students explore different body positions and actions, broadening their 
            <br>database of meaningful gestures and growing intentionality and coordination with 
            their movements.
         </p>

        <h3>Movement for Form and Expression</h3>
        <p>Movement for Form and Expression begins to give our movement activities a little more direction. 
            This explores how movement can be both responsive and expressive. 
            <br>Form is the way music is organized. Students learn how to move in ways that differentiate 
            between separate musical themes within a single piece of music. This can be as 
            <br>simple as clapping in one section and stomping in another. However it can become more
            complex and abstract as we reflect on qualities of music like 
            <br>tempo/dynamics/articulation and brainstorm how to show the difference between smooth/flowing/gentle 
            sounds and brisk/sharp/loud sounds using 
            <br>only movement.

        </p>

        <h3>Movement with the Beat</h3>
        <p>This final step directly links movement to the pulse of the music. Neurological studies have shown 
            that rhythm is actually learned through the sensation of touch, rather than sight or sound. 
            <br>Approaching rhythm with a strong movement focus is critical for students to truly internalize 
            the concepts of beat and meter. Our youngest students build their understanding of rhythm 
            <br>by first learning to identify the steady beat-- that is, the "pulse" or "heartbeat" of the music.
            As they grow in rhythmic fluency, they learn to identify bigger concepts such as 
            <br>meter, subdivision, and syncopation.

        <h2 id="final">About Dr. John M Feierabend</h2>
        <p> Dr. John M Feierabend was born on Novemeber 29, 1952.
        </p>
        <p>He has spent his career as a music educator, researcher, and pedagogue.</p>
        <p>His curricula, First Steps in Music and Conversational Solfege, are designed to promote 
            and foster musicianship 
            <br>and music literacy starting in early childhood. They draw from the methodologies of Edwin Gordon (the 
            <br>Gordon Music Learning Theory) and Zoltán Kodály (the Kodaly Method).
